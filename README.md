#SQL_tutorial

The most basic SQL commands and how to pass those directly from Python to MySQL are presented in here as an introductory tutorial.

These basic commands are included in the jupyter notebook "MovieRater.ipynb". Besides, two extra notebooks from where more complex operations can be performed are "update_rating.ipynb", which allows to update a rating in a very straightforward way but covering few error-handling clauses, and "new_entry.ipynb", a more complex file which allows to register new users/reviewers, store new ratings and update existing ones.

Prerequisites:
	-MySQL has to be installed.
	-The tutorial make uses of environmental variables for the user and password of the database, however those can also be directly inputted as alternatively suggested in the 	"MovieRater.ipynb" file.
